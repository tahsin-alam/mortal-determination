# Mortal Determination
CSC 599.70 - Intro to Data Science  
Team 4: James, Jane, Pooneet, Tahsin
## Objective
Our project revolves around mortality rates in the United States and the factors that affect them. Some factors that we plan to look into include income, education, and air quality. Our goal is to compare the how strongly correlated the various factors are with mortality and understand where efforts need to be taken to help reduce loss of life.

## Running Notebooks
Make sure that the dependencies are met. We recommend using a virtual environment to install and run the Jupyter Notebooks.

Create virtual environment:
```
virtualenv -p python3 .venv
```

Use virtual environment:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run Jupyter:
```
jupyter notebook
```
